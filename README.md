Shareabouts is an online mapping tool to gather crowd sourced public input in a
social and engaging process. Using Shareabouts, people can drop a pin on a map
to provide ideas, suggestions, and comments for planning and design issues. It
complements and extends the reach of your existing or future project by
collecting input from the people who know the city best. And as a
mobile-friendly application, Shareabouts makes it easy to add input on the go.
